Bike Sales Data Analysis
This repository showcases an in-depth analysis of bike sales data performed using Microsoft Excel. The project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, trend analysis, and the development of interactive dashboards to support strategic business decisions.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to transform raw bike sales data into actionable insights. This involved a comprehensive workflow from initial data preparation to the creation of a dynamic dashboard for performance monitoring and strategic planning.

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Categorization:

Thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed raw sales data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Categorized customer demographics and purchasing patterns to reveal key segments and behaviors.

Implemented data validation techniques to maintain data quality throughout the analysis.

Trend Analysis:

Identified significant sales trends over various periods.

Analyzed purchasing patterns across different customer segments (e.g., by age, income, region, education, occupation).

Uncovered insights into product popularity and performance.

Interactive Excel Dashboard:

Developed a comprehensive and user-friendly dashboard in Excel.

Visualized key metrics such as:

Total Sales Performance

Customer Segmentation (e.g., by marital status, gender, income, children, education, occupation, home ownership, commute distance, region, age)

Product Trends and Popularity

Bike Purchase Propensity

Designed the dashboard to be intuitive, allowing stakeholders to quickly grasp performance and make informed decisions.

Files in This Repository
Bike_Sales_Data.xlsx - bike_buyers.csv: The initial raw bike sales data.

Bike_Sales_Data.xlsx - Working Sheet.csv: The cleaned and processed data, including any derived categories or calculations.

Bike_Sales_Data.xlsx - Dashboard.csv: The CSV export of the Excel dashboard, illustrating the visualizations and key metrics. (Note: The interactive nature of the Excel dashboard is best experienced by opening the original .xlsx file if available).


Open the Excel Files:

To view the raw data, open Bike_Sales_Data.xlsx - bike_buyers.csv.

To see the cleaned data and intermediate calculations, open Bike_Sales_Data.xlsx - Working Sheet.csv.

To experience the full interactive dashboard, it is recommended to open the original Bike_Sales_Data.xlsx file (if provided separately, as CSV exports lose interactivity). The Bike_Sales_Data.xlsx - Dashboard.csv file provides a static representation of the dashboard's output.

Conclusion
This project highlights practical data analysis skills in Excel, from meticulous data cleaning to the creation of impactful visualizations. The insights derived can empower businesses to optimize marketing strategies, product development, and overall sales performance.
